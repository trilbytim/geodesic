Instructions:

1) Load ProperJob

2) Select convexedmesh and drivecurve and run gui_genstockcirclescreatortask

3) Select stockcircles and load up gen_constthickonstockcirclestask, then click 
Apply several times, preview what the thickness will be using See Onion Layers

4) Select planwindings and run gui_genpathfromplanwindings

5) Select outputwindings and run gui_postprocesswindings.  

6) Toolpath output is in fillwind11.src

-----------------

Further macros are verify the output and to visualize vector and sweep surfaces 
for bad corners and creases.

[*] OptionTestMinimal checked on gui_genpathfromplanwindings does one winding 
per layer so we can see the worst parts (the joins)



-----------------

To see the stock based on the outputwindings, 

1) Select a set of stockcircles to define the extend of the stock model, and 
run gui_stockmeshcreatortask, chosing the angle step and column steps according 
to the fineness of the mesh

2) Select the sstockshape and the paths in the outputwindings and run 
gui_stockviewertask to create the mstock mesh of the stock in that area
