Instructions:

1) Load ProperJob

2) Select convexedmesh and drivecurve and run gui_genstockcirclescreatortask

3) Select stockcircles and load up gen_constthickonstockcirclestask, then click 
Apply several times, preview what the thickness will be using See Onion Layers

3a) You can set the current splay angle back to 18, and increase 
Desired thickness (*and* DThickness lower) in order to build more layers 
over the top of the current layer.  

Set the windingprefix to, say, "m" to distinguish it in the next stage

4) Select planwindings and run gui_genpathfromplanwindings

4a) Do the planwindings in batches selected by the windingprefix
and set the thickness offset to the normal offset, and Output windings 
to save to a separate folder for the layer 

5) Select outputwindings and run gui_postprocesswindings.  

6) Toolpath output is in fillwind11.src

-----------------

Further macros are verify the output and to visualize vector and sweep surfaces 
for bad corners and creases.

[*] OptionTestMinimal checked on gui_genpathfromplanwindings does one winding 
per layer so we can see the worst parts (the joins)



-----------------

To see the stock based on the outputwindings, 

1) Select a set of stockcircles to define the extend of the stock model, and 
run gui_stockmeshcreatortask, chosing the angle step and column steps according 
to the fineness of the mesh

2) Select the sstockshape and the paths in the outputwindings and run 
gui_stockviewertask to create the mstock mesh of the stock in that area
